	<li class="flex-item">PowerUps: a misprinted coin with 2 head faces guaranteeing you'll win. a spare coin letting you throw 2 and picking the better option. a chipped coin that is more likely to land on heads. a fake coin that is very likely to land on heads. a blank coin that lets you skip the encounter (1-5 only) but you recive no rewards for the encounter</li>
